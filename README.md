# Pattern Creator
As part of a university project, I was asked to build a Pattern creator in JavaScript inside the browser window.

The patterns had to be designed according to the methedology deployed in the five design sheet.

Sheet 1. Brain Storm
  Think of your idea, perhaps just let your hand wander on a piece of paper.
 
Sheets 2,3,4. Initial Designs
  Design a number of patterns across 3 pages.

Sheet 5.
  Pick your favourite.
  
# About The Code:
I wanted to make my design snake across the screen. Initially I did not think of the code implications of this idea.

When it came to writing the code I had realised this was a semi-difficult design. 

For I had to use Trigonometry to create the graphics you see in the html.

Having completed the exercise I added a button for the user to change their design (alters the numerics behind the Sin, Cos, Tan Waves).

Written in my 3rd year of university.
